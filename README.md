The Biglumber map
=================

This little mockup shows all the [biglumber.com](http://biglumber.com) listings on a [Leaflet](http://leafletjs.com/) map. 
The site is deployed on GitHub Pages at [filosottile.github.com/Biglumber-map](http://filosottile.github.com/Biglumber-map/).

Biglumber is a site for coordinating GPG keys signing. People who are available to sign other people keys put a listing there.
This map makes it easier to find listings near you. Go getting into the strong set!
