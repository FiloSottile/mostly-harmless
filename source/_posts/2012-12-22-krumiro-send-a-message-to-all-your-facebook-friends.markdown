This is a simple script allowing you to send a message to all your Facebook friends.

### Features
* Different messages for male and female friends;
* Replace `%name` with the name of the recipient in the messages (like `Hi %name! ...`);
* Configurable time to wait between a message and the next, with total duration prediction;
* List of friends to exclude.

If you have any request or suggestion, simply leave a comment.

### Installation
* Drag this "<a href="javascript:(function(d){var js, ref = d.getElementsByTagName('script')[0];js = d.createElement('script'); js.async = true;js.src = 'https://gist.github.com/raw/4215248/krumiro_en.js';ref.parentNode.insertBefore(js, ref);}(document));">Krumiro</a>" to your bookmarks bar;
* Done! Now the Krumiro button is ready.

### Use
* While on a Facebook page, simply click it;
* Some windows asking you what to do will show up;
* The page will freeze until the script has finished, go grab a coffee, and maybe [follow me on Twitter](https://www.twitter.com).
