I've recently teamed up with a friend of mine, Alessio Palmero, to extend the reach of the [RECAP][recap] extension to the Appellate Courts documents and win a [grant][grant] offered by PlainSite in memory of [Aaron Swartz][aaron].

The Firefox (and now Chrome) extension intercepts public domain documents downloaded from the pay-walled legal archive [PACER][pacer] and uploads them to the [Internet Archive][archive]. Freely available documents are then marked as such for the sake of a juster access to public records.

Details and comments in the linked blog post.
