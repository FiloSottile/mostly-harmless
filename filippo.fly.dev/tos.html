<p>1. About Geomys and the Service</p>
<p>Geomys handles the CMVP validation of the FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module, and contributes the module to the upstream Go project, for the benefit of the Go community.</p>
<p>The FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module is distributed as part of the upstream Go toolchain, where it is seamlessly integrated with the cryptography packages of the Go standard library, and its use and technical details are documented at https://go.dev/doc/security/fips140. All FIPS 140-3 approved algorithms in the standard library are implemented by the module, including post-quantum key exchange algorithm ML-KEM, and the module is tested on a wide range of platforms.</p>
<p>Geomys provides additional commercial services in support of the certification and compliance requirements of Go enterprises, including the Service for which You are subscribing. The Service (Essential Plan) is a lightweight and cost-effective offering that provides timely information to effectively deploy the upstream FIPS 140-3 Go Cryptographic Module in your development cycle, with supporting material to answer the questions of customers and auditors. This includes:</p>
<ul>

</li>
<li>
<p>Ready-to-download attestation with all the details of in-progress and completed validations, including name and version, Operating Environments, installation instructions, tested algorithms, and CMVP status.</p>
