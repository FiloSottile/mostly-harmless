<h1 id="ticketbleed-(cve-2016-9244)">Ticketbleed <span style="white-space: nowrap;">(CVE-2016-9244)</span></h1>
<p><img src="ticketbleed.png" alt="ticketbleed.png"> </p><p>Ticketbleed is a software vulnerability in the TLS/SSL stack of F5 BIG-IP appliances allowing a remote attacker to extract up to 31 bytes of uninitialized memory at a time.</p><p>This memory can potentially contain key material or sensitive data from other connections.</p><p>It is similar in spirit and implications to the well known Heartbleed vulnerability. It is different in that it exposes 31 bytes at a time instead of 64k, requiring more rounds to carry out an attack, and in that it affects the proprietary F5 TLS stack, not OpenSSL.</p><p>F5 published <a href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K05121675">article K05121675</a> addressing this vulnerability. You can read <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/finding-ticketbleed/">the story of how Ticketbleed was found and a complete technical walkthrough</a> on the Filippo.io blog.</p>
<h2 id="test">Test</h2>
<p>The online test was discontinued in March 2021.</p>
<p>You can use <a href="https://gist.github.com/FiloSottile/fc7822b1f5b475a25e58d77d1b394860">this Go script</a> or the <a href="https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/">SSL Labs online test</a> instead.</p>
<p>Note: there are other implementations that exhibit a similar bug which might not have security implications.</p>
<h2 id="technical-details">Technical Details</h2>
<p>The vulnerability lies in the implementation of Session Tickets, a resumption technique used to speed up repeated connections.</p><p>When a client supplies a Session ID together with a Session Ticket, the server is supposed to echo back the Session ID to signal acceptance of the ticket. Session IDs can be anywhere between 1 and 31 bytes in length.</p><p>The F5 stack always echoes back 32 bytes of memory, even if the Session ID was shorter. An attacker providing a 1-byte Session ID would then receive 31 bytes of uninitialized memory.</p>
<h2 id="fixes-and-mitigation">Fixes and mitigation</h2>
<p>The full list of affected versions is available on the <a href="https://support.f5.com/csp/article/K05121675">F5 website</a>. At the time of this public disclosure not all releases have upgrade candidates available.</p><p>Disabling Session Tickets is a complete mitigation, which will only cause a performance degradation in the set-up phase of resumed connections.</p><p>Reproduced here are the instructions provided by F5 and available at the link above.</p><ol><li>Log in to the Configuration utility</li><li>Navigate on the menu to Local Traffic &gt; Profiles &gt; SSL &gt; Client</li><li>Toggle the option for Configuration from Basic to Advanced</li><li>Uncheck the Session Ticket option to disable the feature</li><li>Click Update to save the changes</li></ol>
<h2 id="internet-scan-results">Internet scan results</h2>
<p>Internet scans were performed using a modified version of zgrab, by obtaining and immediately using a Session Ticket with a 31-byte Session ID.</p>

<p>Vulnerable means the host replied with unexpected memory, Accepted means that the host correctly accepted the Session Ticket, Rejected means the host offered a Session Ticket but then rejected it when the client tried to use it. All remaining hosts didn&#39;t offer Session Tickets.</p><p>All wide scans originated from IP address 185.47.61.3. I&#39;d like to thank <a href="https://www.bhost.net/">BHost</a> for offering the stable VPS and the bandwidth necessary to perform the scan, and for taking care of the inbound abuse letters.</p>
<h2 id="detection-and-ids">Detection and IDS</h2>
<p>The issue can be identified by passive traffic monitoring, as the Session ID field is unencrypted.</p><p>However, I&#39;d like to strongly discourage IDS vendors from making signatures that simply detect Session IDs shorter than 32 bytes. Any length between 1 and 32 bytes is legal according to the RFC specification.</p><p>The Go standard library legitimately uses 16 bytes Session IDs, and browsers considered using 1 byte Session IDs for this purpose. It&#39;s important for security software not to needlessly constrain future decisions in that direction.</p>
<h2 id="discovery-and-timeline">Discovery and timeline</h2>
<p>The issue was identified by <a href="https://twitter.com/FiloSottile">Filippo Valsorda</a> of the Cloudflare Crypto Team in collaboration with other Cloudflare employees, while debugging a customer issue. You can read <a href="https://blog.filippo.io/finding-ticketbleed/">the full story</a> on the Filippo.io blog.</p><p>It was reported on October 26, 2016 and subject to a <a href="https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/feedback-and-data-driven-updates-to.html">90 + 15 days disclosure policy</a>.
