<h1>The Sunlight CT Log</h1>
<p>Sunlight is a <a href="https://certificate.transparency.dev/">Certificate Transparency</a>
log implementation and monitoring API designed for scalability, ease of operation,
and reduced cost.</p>
<p>What started as the Sunlight API is now the <a href="https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api">Static CT API</a>
and is allowed by the CT log policies of the major browsers.</p>
<p>Sunlight was designed by <a href="https://filippo.io">Filippo Valsorda</a> for the
needs of the WebPKI community, through the feedback of many of its members,
and in particular of the <a href="https://www.sigsum.org/">Sigsum</a>,
<a href="https://transparency.dev/">Google TrustFabric</a>,
and <a href="https://www.isrg.org/">ISRG</a> teams.
It is partially based on the <a href="https://golang.org/design/25530-sumdb">Go Checksum Database</a>.
Sunlight's development was sponsored by <a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">Let's Encrypt</a>.</p>
<p>If you have feedback on the design, please join the conversation on the
<a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/ct-policy">ct-policy mailing list</a>,
or in the <a href="https://transparency-dev.slack.com/archives/C06PCS2P75Y">#sunlight channel</a>
of the <a href="https://join.slack.com/t/transparency-dev/shared_invite/zt-27pkqo21d-okUFhur7YZ0rFoJVIOPznQ">transparency-dev Slack</a>.</p>
<p>For more information, read the
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2024/03/14/introducing-sunlight/">introductory blog post</a>.</p>
<p>We have a set of resources for various WebPKI stakeholders. Are you…</p>
<p><strong>… a log operator?</strong>
You can find the open source Sunlight implementation at
<a href="https://github.com/FiloSottile/sunlight">github.com/FiloSottile/sunlight</a>
and the original design document,
including a description of the Sunlight architecture and tradeoffs,
at <a href="https://filippo.io/a-different-CT-log">filippo.io/a-different-CT-log</a>.</p>
<p>There are other implementations of Static CT:
<a href="https://github.com/cloudflare/azul">Azul</a> by Cloudflare, which was accompanyed by a
<a href="https://blog.cloudflare.com/azul-certificate-transparency-log">detailed blog post</a>
that also presents the Static CT and Sunlight designs;
and <a href="https://github.com/aditsachde/itko">Itko</a>,
which exposes both the Static CT and RFC 6962 APIs.</p>
<p><strong>… a CT monitor?</strong>
An <a href="https://pkg.go.dev/filippo.io/sunlight#Client">easy to use Go client</a> is available.
The Static CT API is fully specified at <a href="https://c2sp.org/static-ct-api">c2sp.org/static-ct-api</a>,
and you can test against the logs below.</p>
<p>You might be happy to know that the object storage backends some
Static CT log read paths are nearly rate-limit free!</p>
<p>Andrew Ayer also published <a href="https://github.com/AGWA/sunglasses">Sunglasses</a>,
an RFC 6962 compatibility proxy for Static CT logs.</p>
<p><strong>… a certificate authority?</strong> You can submit to Sunlight logs like to any other CT log!</p>
<p>You can use the <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/chromium.org/g/ct-policy/c/KCzYEIIZSxg/m/zD26fYw4AgAJ">Geomys</a> or
<a href="https://letsencrypt.org/docs/ct-logs/#Sunlight">Let's Encrypt</a> logs for testing.</p>
<p><strong>… looking for the logo?</strong>
You can find it <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VqDO8U-AksEoz85CcbLknucNCJl2gwZi">here</a>.
