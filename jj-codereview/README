git update-ref refs/remotes/gerrit/.. FETCH_HEAD

    - doesn't make it a visible commit
    - doesn't move
    - in jj log, unmodified mailed CLs are tagged
    - in jj evolog, you can still see the CL number and how the patchsets evolved
    - ::remote_bookmarks() is stuff that's only local, fits well in the semantic of remote_bookmarks
    - ::remote_bookmarks(remote=gerrit) is stuff that was mailed
    - must exclude it from immutable_heads
