reput connects to a reMarkable via SSH and uploads a file.

    $ reput 172.27.5.215:22 SHA256:HXpOPttnW8Atwy9mnW0tXaMWk8WfFPEN0hgOfFxPnss example.pdf

The reMarkable needs to be awake for the SSH server to be available.

Both PDFs and EPUBs are supported.

Authentication is handled through ssh-agent. Install your SSH keys on the root
account of the reMarkable. The password is in the About tab.

While reput uses SSH for convenience, it just tunnels to the Web UI (instead of
having to deal with the internal file structure and restart the UI).

On supported firware versions (currently only 2.1.1.3), reput will automatically
patch xochitl to keep the Web UI from turning off at each reboot, and to bind it
to the loopback interface, as usb0 isn't configured with an IP at boot.

If you want to backup your files, since you're probably not using the cloud if
you're reading this, they are at this path.

    /home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl

As a personal note, I also disabled crashuploader.

    systemctl disable crashuploader && systemctl stop crashuploader

Finally, here's a script that works as an Automator Print Plugin or Folder
Action with a YubiKey-provided ssh-agent via gpg-agent.

    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=~/.gnupg/S.gpg-agent.ssh
    for f in "$@"
    do
        ~/bin/reput 172.27.5.215:22 SHA256:HXpOPttnW8Atwy9mnW0tXaMWk8WfFPEN0hgOfFxPnss "$f"
    done
