reput connects to a reMarkable via SSH and uploads a file.

    $ reput 172.27.5.215:22 SHA256:CrDRbn2mlTDAalarGb994ZbQuI+i/yn6spxzVOFkRyY example.pdf

The reMarkable needs to be awake for the SSH server to be available.

Both PDFs and EPUBs are supported.

Authentication is handled through ssh-agent. Install your SSH keys on the root
account of the reMarkable. The password is in the About tab.

While reput uses SSH for convenience, it just tunnels to the Web UI (instead of
having to deal with the internal file structure and restart the UI).

You need to enable the USB web interface through the UI at least once per
reboot, but there is no need to leave the USB cable attached.

If you want to backup your files, since you're probably not using the cloud if
you're reading this, they are at this path.

    /home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl

As a personal note, I also installed rsync and disabled crashuploader.

    ./configure CFLAGS="-static" --host="arm-linux-musleabi" && make
    scp rsync root@remarkable.home.arpa:/usr/bin/

    systemctl disable crashuploader && systemctl stop crashuploader

Finally, here's a script that works as an Automator Print Plugin or Folder
Action with a YubiKey-provided ssh-agent via yubikey-agent.

    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
    for f in "$@"
    do
        ~/bin/reput 172.27.5.215:22 SHA256:CrDRbn2mlTDAalarGb994ZbQuI+i/yn6spxzVOFkRyY "$f"
    done
