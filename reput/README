reput connects to a reMarkable via SSH and uploads a file.

    $ reput remarkable:22 SHA256:CrDRbn2mlTDAalarGb994ZbQuI+i/yn6spxzVOFkRyY example.pdf

The reMarkable needs to be awake for the SSH server to be available.

Both PDFs and EPUBs are supported.

Authentication is handled through ssh-agent. Install your SSH keys on the root
account of the reMarkable. The password is in the About tab.

While reput uses SSH for convenience, it just tunnels to the Web UI (instead of
having to deal with the internal file structure and restart the UI). To avoid
re-enabilng the Web UI at every boot, install Toltec and webinterface-onboot.

As a personal note, I also installed rsync, tailscale-systemd, syncthing, and
disabled crashuploader.

    systemctl disable crashuploader && systemctl stop crashuploader

Syncthing is configured with the following folder in "Send only" to a node that
has staggered versioning enabled. Note that outbound Tailscale connections don't
work, so the remote node needs to be configured to connect to the reMarkable.

    /home/root/.local/share/remarkable/xochitl

Finally, here's a script that works as an Automator Print Plugin or Folder
Action with a YubiKey-provided ssh-agent via yubikey-agent.

    export SSH_AUTH_SOCK=/usr/local/var/run/yubikey-agent.sock
    for f in "$@"
    do
        ~/bin/reput remarkable:22 SHA256:CrDRbn2mlTDAalarGb994ZbQuI+i/yn6spxzVOFkRyY "$f"
    done
